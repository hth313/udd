directory. You may change this if you want, by editing paths in defs.h.
Type

    make

to build, and if the build is successful, you can type

    bin/udd

to run the executable.

DATA FILES:
    char.dat
        player characters are saved here. The file as provided contains
        no valid characters, so you will have to create one to start.
    lvl.dat
        Dungeon definitions are kept here. The file as provided contains
        two dungeons, named “Crestwood” and “Squire's Hole”. The latter
        seems more suitable for advanced players.
    not.txt
        A text file to be displayed to the user at game startup.
